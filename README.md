# Museum-automation-Code-in-4-regional-languages in Arduino IDE
This is the code for my  Automation Project of a Spritual Museum at Kollar Karnataka.The code is written in Arduino IDE platform ; Uploaded in Arduino Mega Board.
The automation was done for 13 stalls for 4 different language that is Hindi,Kannada,English & Telgu.
When the Hindi language switched on then OM music palyed & after that welcome music started.Then the light of first stall automatically turns on and the auto explanation starts.When the explanation of that stall turn off then the light turns off & the light of next stall turns on & the explantion started simultaneously.This repeats until its reach to the last stall.The process is same for automation in other 3 languages too.
